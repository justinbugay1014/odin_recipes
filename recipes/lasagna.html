        <h4><b>Directions:</b></h4>
        
        <ol>
         <p><li>Cook and stir ground beef, onion, garlic powder, and 
        oregano in a large skillet over medium heat until 
        onion is tender and beef is browned, about 10 minutes. 
        Add tomato sauce and sugar; simmer until sauce is 
        heated through, about 10 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally 
            until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Drain.</li></p>
        <p><li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
            Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li></p>
        <p><li>Mix ricotta cheese, egg, parsley, and 3/4 cup 
            Parmesan cheese together in a bowl.</li></p>
        <p><li>Place a lasagna noodle on a work surface. Spoon 
            one layer ricotta cheese mixture, one layer meat 
            sauce, and one layer mozzarella cheese atop lasagna 
            noodle; top with another lasagna noodle. Roll up the 
            stuffed lasagna noodles in the jelly-roll style; 
            place in the prepared casserole dish. Repeat with 
            remaining lasagna noodles, ricotta cheese mixture, 
            meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. Spread a spoonful
             of meat sauce atop each lasagna roll; top with 
             remaining mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan 
             cheese.</li></p>
        <p><li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted 
            and bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes.</li></p>
